Traditionally, for every program that weâ€™d like to execute,
we need to first compile it.
It seems unnecessarily lengthy process for small programs for testing purposes.

Java 11 changes it and now we can execute Java source code contained in a single file
without the need to compile it first.

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

To execute above class, run it directly with java command.

$ java HelloWorld.java

Hello World!
