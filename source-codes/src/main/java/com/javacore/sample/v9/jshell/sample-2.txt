=== Working with variables ===

When we do not assign the result of an expression to variable,
a scratch variable is created so that the output of expression can be used later.
These scratch variables are created by name of $1, $2, $3 and so on.
Let's have a look at the following examples to understand it better.

jshell> 1+2
$1 ==> 3

jshell> 2+5
$2 ==> 7

jshell> System.out.println("sum of the two scratch variables is:"+($1+$2))
sum of the two scratch variables is:10

jshell> $1+$2
$4 ==> 10

=== JShell â€“ variables ===

We can also name the variables in JShell,
just like we do in the actual java program.

jshell> int var = 100
var ==> 100

jshell> int num = var - 90
num ==> 10

jshell> System.out.println(num)
10


Note: We can also change the type of the variable, as you can see in the blew example
that we have changed the type of variable num from int to String.
Doing this would change the value of the variable to the default value
of the changed data type,
in our example we have change the num from int to String
so that value of num is changed from 10 to null.

This is especially useful when you do not want to create unnecessary variables
and reuse the ones which you have already created.

jshell> String num
num ==> null

jshell> System.out.println(num)
null
